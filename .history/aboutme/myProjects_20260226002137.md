# My Computer Science Projects

## 1. character comparision webstie
* **Description:** A perfesional, side by side comparison of one of the greatest rivalry wide receiver, defensive back matchups in the NFL's history.
* **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, VS code
### Here is a snippet of code:

        <ul>
            <li> Extremly fast </li>
            <li> Great Coverage Skills </li>
            <li> Hard Hitter </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Josh Norman is an All-Pro cornerback who famously helped lead the Carolina Panthers to a Super Bowl appearance in 2015. Known for his elite coverage and vocal personality, he recorded 16 interceptions and 20 forced fumbles over a standout 12-season career. </p>

## What I learned
* **1.:** properly use flex boxes to put certain elements side by side and play around with spacing. I also learned how to code more efficantly.
* **2.** Use a sticky box title.

## 1. Tic Tac Toe psuedo code and algorithm
* **Description:** A detailed outline for a C# program that runs the game tic tac toe. this outline includes a full run down of psuedo code and a detailed algorithm made on draw.io foir visual puposes.
* **Tech Stack:** C#, psuedo code
### Here is a snippet of code:
```
IF position is NOT a valid integer

            		DISPLAY "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number."

        	ELSE IF position < 1 || position > 9

            		DISPLAY "Invalid position. Please enter a number between 1 and 9."

        	ELSE IF gameBoard position is already occupied (contains 'X' or 'O')

            		DISPLAY "Position already taken. Try again."
		ELSE
			INPUT = Draw board //print the answer on the board
			Rounds += 1


```

## What I learned
* **1.:** writing proper psuedo code, showing the basic logic behind the program before starting the implementation phase
* **2.** making a visual algorithm
